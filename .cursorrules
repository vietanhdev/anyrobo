# AnyRobo Code Guidelines

- Use anyrobo packages as the core. Modify any modules freely to develop new features, and examples as needed.
- Use best practices for Python programming.
- Use type hints for all functions and variables.
- Break down complex functions into smaller, more manageable ones.
- Break down large files into smaller ones.
- Use meaningful variable and function names.
- Add docstrings to all functions and classes.
- Add comments to explain why behind the code in more complex functions.
- Keep functions small and focused (single responsibility).
- Handle errors and edge cases gracefully.
- We are in active development. Code will break. Don't be afraid to break things and don't need to maintain backward compatibility.

## Documentation

- Define and use interfaces for event-driven architecture at docs/interfaces.md

## IMPORTANT

- Keep the code simple, clean and readable.
- Keep the code modular and reusable.
- Keep the code efficient and performant.
- Use event-driven architecture.
